# bubble-clicker

## What's this?
This is a clicker game realized in a school project at the SFGZ in Zurich to learn Javascript.

## How to play?
How the name of the game already says, it's a game with many bubbles and you have to click of them to generate points.

While the bubbles move from bottom to top they also move randomly horizontally. If you don't click on them, the bubbles get smaller per second and disappear completely.

But if you click on them, they will grow and if you have reached 15 clicks on a bubble, the bubble will burst and you will get 50 extra points.

You can't play that game infinitely, it's limited to 40 seconds. But of course you can repeat the game at any time.
